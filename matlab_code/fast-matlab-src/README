FAST corner detection in MATLAB. -- Edward Rosten


Five functions are provided:

fast_corner_detect_9
fast_corner_detect_10
fast_corner_detect_11
fast_corner_detect_12
fast_nonmax

for corner detection and nonmaximal suppression. Online help
is provided for all these functions, and an example is provided
in example.m
