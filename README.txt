Quick start
------------------------------------------------------------

After unzipping:

1) Go to matlab_code directory
2) Run mono_slam.m

The zipped file includes an example sequence, so the code should run as it is.
The code has been tested from Matlab 6.5 to Matlab 7.9. 

It should not depend on any specific Matlab toolbox.

The directory matlab_code/figures contains a video displaying what the code should show.

Versions history
=============================================================

1.0
---
- Initial release
- Known things to fix in later versions:
  a) Only Tsai distortion model available
  b) Robocentric not implemented yet.
  c) EKF filter class rather messy.

This code has been developed for research purposes. Please, do expect to find some illustrative examples of bad programming practices :)
